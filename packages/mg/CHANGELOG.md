# @nicknisi/pi-mg

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 74e29ab: Publish compiled JS alongside the TypeScript sources.

  `exports` now resolves to `./dist/index.js` and `./dist/index.d.ts`, while the
  `pi` manifest keeps pointing at `./index.ts`. pi is unaffected — it loads
  extensions through jiti, which transpiles TypeScript on the fly, and local path
  installs still need no build step.

  This fixes every _other_ consumer. Node refuses to strip types inside
  `node_modules` (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`), so anything
  `tsc`-built that imported one of these packages crashed at runtime on the raw
  sources. Bundlers and type resolution get a proper entry point too.

- 25787d2: Compile under `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Unchecked indexed reads are now narrowed or explicitly asserted where the index is in range by construction, and optional properties that can legitimately hold `undefined` declare it. Packages ship raw TypeScript, so this also affects how consumers typecheck against them; runtime behavior is unchanged.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 38fffe5: Add `@nicknisi/pi-mg`: a `/mg` command that plays a Severance-style "100% File Completion" animation starring a pixelated Michael Grinich — MDR grid, 100% burst, landscape reveal, spoken address, departure, and finale. macOS audio via `say`/`afplay`.
