## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cdfbc22: Resolve user config through pi's `getAgentDir()` instead of hardcoding `~/.pi/agent`, so these extensions honor `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and work under harnesses that relocate the agent dir. Behavior is unchanged when the variable is unset.

  `artifacts` resolves diff2html's stylesheet with a direct `import.meta.resolve(...)` call instead of `createRequire`, keeping it loadable under jiti and in single-file bundles.

  `chat-input` now supports prefixes of any cell width. The layout math previously assumed a 1-cell prefix, so a two-cell `prefix` (e.g. `❮❯`) overflowed the box by one cell and under-indented continuation lines. Rendering is unchanged for 1-cell prefixes.

- 648e6df: Add repository/homepage metadata, MIT license field, and oxfmt-canonical package.json formatting for npm provenance links.
