# Self-Compaction

## Problem

Long-running autonomous agents run out of context.

Long running context reduces performance (context rot) and burns cash (state of the art models).

These agents are primarily built for long-running, autonomous, no human in the loop "out loop" agentic work.

## Solution

Build an extension for the pi coding agent with a few key features.

1. `self_compact(note_to_self)` - allow the agent to compact itself.
1. `Context Control` - Three unique threshold levels: notice, warning, forced compaction with cli flags to support it.
1. `Pi UI` - A UI to match the three compaction levels.
1. `Prompt Engineering` - Concrete prompts for each interaction with our agent (compaction prompt, soft notice user prompt, warning user prompt)
1. `HIL commands` - concrete commands to showcase our threshold limits and to force a compaction by hand.

## Variables

- `PROJECT_ROOT: ~/Developer/pi-extensions`
  \-`YOUR_WORKING_DIR: <PROJECT_ROOT>/packages/self-compact`
- `PLAN_DIR: <PROJECT_ROOT>/docs/ideation/self-compact`

## Workflow

1. Plan and Build. Use `/ideation` to create an implementation plan from these requirements.
1. Verify. Check every item in Definition of Done, fix failures, and rerun the affected checks. Keep final verification
   artifacts inside `YOUR_WORKING_DIR` and report actual results and any remaining blockers.

## Definition of Done

### Workflow Complete

- You completed ideation plan exists in `docs/ideation`.
- The `pi-self-compact` extension loads as a standalone extension, with small helpers as needed and no dependency on
  other extensions.

### Self Compact Tool

- The handoff tool resumes real work.
  - `self_compact({note_to_self: "..."})` rejects blank notes and notes over 24,000 characters, saves valid notes, and ends the current run cleanly.
  - Expected: compact only once idle, return the note verbatim, restore tools, and continue without another user message.
  - For a task whose saved next action is to write `YOUR_WORKING_DIR/result.txt` containing `done`, verify that exact file result after continuation. A completed task must not restart.
  - Failed or cancelled compaction preserves the note and keeps other tools locked until success. Retry and reload recovery retain the handoff.

### User Interface

- The context bar shows usage and thresholds.
  - Expected example: `[###~====-!-|--------] 40%`, with default thresholds and half the used context cached.
  - Verify 20 cells at 5% each, cached `#`, uncached `=`, free `-`, and visible `~` / `!` / `|` markers at 20% / 50% / 60%.
  - The token-based launch on a 1,000,000-token model moves markers to 10% / 20% / 25%. A zero buffer shows `|` where warning and forced overlap.

### Prompt Engineering

- Files are in correct places:
  - `YOUR_WORK_DIR/.pi/self-compact/USER_PROMPT_SOFT_SELF_COMPACT.md` supplies editable soft OPTIONAL guidance with live usage values. Runs from `--compact-soft-at`.
  - `YOUR_WORK_DIR/.pi/self-compact/USER_PROMPT_WARNING_SELF_COMPACT.md` supplies a more stern 'time to compact soon, hard cutoff at ...' message. Runs from `--compact-at`.
  - `YOUR_WORK_DIR/.pi/self-compact/USER_PROMPT_COMPACTION_MESSAGE.md` replaces pi coding agent default compaction prompt. Is overridden by `--compact-prompt`

### Compact Thresholds

- All four flags work.
  - `--compact-soft-at 20%`: optional heads-up, tools remain available.
  - `--compact-at 50%`: ask the agent to write its note and compact, without blocking ordinary tools yet.
  - `--compact-buffer 10%`: allow ten more percentage points of the model window, then block other tools at 60%. Accept `0` for immediate enforcement.
  - `--compact-prompt "..."`: replace the summary system prompt with literal text, independently of the saved note and optional user-prompt file.
  - Thresholds and buffer accept whole token counts, `k`/`m` suffixes, or percentages `%`. Cap the hard limit at 90% and reject invalid settings.
  - Defaults (after testing. test with lower amounts)
    - soft: 225k
    - warning: 250k
    - force: 270k

### Launch Commands

- Launch variants produce expected results:
  - `pi -e "$YOUR_WORKING_DIR/extensions/self-compact/self-compact.ts"`
    - Expected launch with the defaults: 225k, 250k, 270k. Use a combo of `k` and `%`.
  - `pi -e "$YOUR_WORKING_DIR/extensions/self-compact/self-compact.ts" --compact-soft-at 100k --compact-at 200k --compact-buffer 50k`
  - Expected: soft at 100,000 tokens, warning at 200,000, and other tools blocked at 250,000. Use a model with at least a 300,000-token window.
  - `pi -e "$YOUR_WORKING_DIR/extensions/self-compact/self-compact.ts" --compact-soft-at 20% --compact-at 50% --compact-buffer 0 --compact-prompt "Summarize the current goal, completed work, exact paths, test results, and next action. Do not invent completed work."`
  - Expected: soft at 20%, other tools blocked at 50%, and the supplied summary system prompt used. The saved note returns separately after success.

### HIL Commands

- Slash commands are available.
  - `/self-compact-info`: show settings, resolved thresholds, usage, state, cycle count, prompt details, and pending notes or errors without starting an LLM turn.
  - `/self-compact-now`: ask the agent to write its note and call `self_compact`. On retry, include the saved note rather than inventing one or bypassing the tool.
  - `/compact`: retain Pi’s manual escape hatch outside the required-note workflow, while honoring the configured summary overrides. (Don't touch built in)

## How You're Graded

- You'll be graded on a continuous basis based on every completed bullet in the definition of done.
- Every step of Workflow must be fully accomplished: plan, build and verify.
- Instant failure if you write project deliverables outside your `YOUR_WORKING_DIR` with the exception of `PLAN_DIR`
- Running tools outside these directories is allowed. Temporary files and tool-managed runtime data (caches, logs, browser profiles, updater logs) may use their normal locations and are not grading failures.
- If you find you've mistakenly caused a failure stop immediately and report your failure.
